# Project Review Summary

## Project Structure Provisioned

The Cyberpunk GM Screen v2 project has been fully structured with the following key elements:

### 1. Directory Structure
✅ Complete separation of concerns:
- GitHub repository files (src/, public/, tests/)
- Local development files (docs/, project-management/, scripts/)
- Proper .gitignore to keep repository clean

### 2. Development Environment
✅ Docker configuration ready:
- Dockerfile for Node.js development
- docker-compose.yml for easy container management
- Volumes mapped to Windows directory
- Port 5173 exposed for Vite development server

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline
✅ GitHub Actions workflows configured:
- Continuous Integration (ci.yml)
- Continuous Deployment to GitHub Pages (cd.yml)
- Pull Request checks (pr-checks.yml)
- Issue templates and PR template

### 4. React Project Setup
✅ Modern React stack configured:
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for fast development
- Zustand for state management
- Vitest for testing
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality

### 5. Documentation
✅ Comprehensive documentation:
- Project requirements defined
- Development setup guide
- Component structure documented
- Accessibility guidelines included

### 6. Component Architecture
✅ Well-organized component structure:
- Core layout components
- GM tools components
- Reference panels
- Interactive elements
- Utility components
- Accessibility components

## Key Considerations Addressed

1. **Windows 11 + Docker Desktop**: Configuration optimized for Windows development
2. **Local/Container Symlink**: Proper volume mapping configured
3. **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Base URL and deployment scripts ready
4. **Clean Repository**: Separation of development files from production code
5. **Agile/CI/CD**: Complete workflow with issue tracking and automated deployment
6. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance built into architecture
7. **Mobile-First**: Responsive design principles established

## Next Steps

1. Initialize git repository and push to GitHub
2. Set up Docker container and test development environment
3. Create initial React components
4. Configure GitHub repository settings for Pages deployment
5. Begin implementing core features following the component architecture

The project is now ready for development with a solid foundation for a modern, accessible, and maintainable Cyberpunk Red GM Screen application.
