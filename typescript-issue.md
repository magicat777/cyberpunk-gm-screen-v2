## Summary
The codebase has numerous TypeScript type errors that prevent successful compilation with type checking enabled. While the application builds and deploys successfully with type checking disabled, these issues should be resolved for better type safety and development experience.

## Primary Issues

### 1. Form Component Event Handler Mismatch
- TextInput, TextArea, and Select components use `onChange: (value: string) => void`
- Code expects standard React event handlers like `onChange: (e: React.ChangeEvent) => void`
- Affects hundreds of instances across the codebase

### 2. Type Definition Inconsistencies
- Character interface has `hitPoints` but code references `hp`
- Skill is an array but code treats it as an object
- Stat has `value` property but code expects `current`
- Missing properties: `ammo` on Weapon, `inventory` on Character, etc.

### 3. Icon and Button Component Mismatches
- Invalid icon names ("trash" → "remove", "pencil" → "edit", etc.)
- Wrong size values ("small" → "sm", "large" → "lg")
- Button variant "ghost" should be "tertiary"
- Button uses `icon` prop, not `startIcon`/`endIcon`

### 4. Missing Type Imports and Definitions
- Components missing proper type imports
- Select component requires options array, not children
- Type assertion issues with string literals

## Current Workaround
- TypeScript checks disabled in build process
- Critical runtime errors fixed
- Deployment working successfully

## Proposed Solution
1. Update all event handlers to match component signatures
2. Fix type definitions to match actual usage
3. Update all icon names and button variants
4. Add missing type imports
5. Re-enable TypeScript in build process

## Priority
Medium - The app is functional but lacks type safety
