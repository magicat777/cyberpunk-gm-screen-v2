# ESLint Setup Summary

## Installed Plugins
The following ESLint plugins have been successfully installed and configured:
- `eslint-plugin-security` - Security vulnerability detection
- `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` - React Hooks best practices  
- `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` - Accessibility rules for JSX
- `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` - TypeScript-specific rules

## Configuration Files Updated

### eslint.config.js
- Updated to include all new plugins
- Configured with recommended rules from each plugin
- Added custom rules for TypeScript, React, and accessibility
- Fixed issues with globals configuration

### .eslintrc.json
- Updated to include new plugins
- Maintained for compatibility with tools that don't support flat config

### package.json
- Updated lint scripts to work with new flat config format
- Added `lint:fix` script for automatic fixing

## Current ESLint Status
After running the linter, the following types of issues were detected:
1. **Accessibility issues** - Invalid href values, missing labels
2. **Security warnings** - Object injection detection
3. **TypeScript errors** - Undefined globals, non-null assertions
4. **React Hooks warnings** - Missing dependencies

## Next Steps
1. Fix the detected ESLint issues using `npm run lint:fix`
2. Manually address issues that can't be auto-fixed
3. Add missing globals (setTimeout, clearTimeout) to configuration
4. Consider adjusting rule severity based on project needs

## Available Commands
```bash
# Run ESLint
npm run lint

# Fix auto-fixable issues
npm run lint:fix

# Run with specific format
npm run lint -- --format compact
```

## Enhanced Security & Accessibility
The new configuration provides:
- Security vulnerability detection
- WCAG compliance checks
- React best practices enforcement
- TypeScript type safety improvements
