# Local Documentation Note

This repository contains the production code for the Cyberpunk GM Screen.

The following directories contain project documentation and are NOT included in the GitHub repository:

- `/docs/` - Contains all project documentation, wireframes, and specifications
- `/project-management/` - Contains agile planning, phase documentation, and project roadmap
- `/scripts/` - Contains Docker configurations and deployment scripts

These files are maintained locally and should be backed up separately from the GitHub repository to keep the production repository clean.
