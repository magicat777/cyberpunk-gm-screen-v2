## Summary
The Session Management component lacks configurable states and functionality. It appears to be a placeholder without the ability to create, edit, or manage game sessions.

## Current Behavior
- Session Management page exists but has minimal functionality
- No ability to create new sessions
- No configurable session properties
- No session state management (active, completed, planned)
- No integration with other GM tools

## Expected Behavior
- Create new sessions with customizable properties
- Edit existing sessions
- Manage session states (planning, active, completed, archived)
- Link sessions to encounters, NPCs, and other game data
- Session notes and summary functionality
- Session history and timeline tracking

## Proposed Features
### Session Properties
- Session name and description
- Date/time (scheduled and actual)
- Player attendance tracking
- Location (in-game and real-world)
- Session status (planned, active, completed, cancelled)
- Notes (pre-session prep, post-session summary)
- Linked encounters and NPCs
- XP/rewards distributed

### Session Management
- List view of all sessions
- Filter by status, date, players
- Quick actions (start, complete, archive)
- Session templates for recurring games
- Import/export session data

### Integration Points
- Link to Initiative Tracker for combat
- Connect to Character sheets for XP updates
- Associate with Encounters for session planning
- Timer integration for session duration

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Can create new sessions with basic properties
- [ ] Sessions persist across page refreshes
- [ ] Can edit existing session details
- [ ] Can change session status
- [ ] Session list shows all sessions with filtering
- [ ] Can add notes and summaries to sessions
- [ ] Can link other game elements to sessions

## Technical Implementation
- Extend session store with full CRUD operations
- Create session creation/edit forms
- Implement session list with filtering
- Add localStorage persistence
- Create session status workflow

## Priority
Medium - Important for campaign management but not blocking core gameplay
