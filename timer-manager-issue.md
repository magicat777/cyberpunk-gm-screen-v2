## Summary
The Timer Manager component is missing functional start/stop/reset buttons for individual timers. The buttons are visible but appear to be non-functional or improperly implemented.

## Current Behavior
- Start/Stop/Reset buttons are displayed for each timer
- Buttons do not trigger expected timer actions
- Timers cannot be controlled after creation

## Expected Behavior
- Start button should begin countdown/stopwatch
- Stop/Pause button should pause the timer
- Reset button should reset timer to initial value
- Visual feedback when timer is running

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to GM Tools > Timer Manager
2. Create a new timer
3. Try to use Start/Stop/Reset buttons
4. Observe that timers don't respond to button clicks

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Start button begins timer operation
- [ ] Stop/Pause button pauses active timer
- [ ] Reset button returns timer to initial state
- [ ] Visual indication of timer state (running/paused)
- [ ] Timer values update in real-time when running

## Technical Notes
- Check event handler implementations
- Verify state updates are triggering re-renders
- Ensure interval/timeout management is correct

## Priority
High - Core functionality is broken
