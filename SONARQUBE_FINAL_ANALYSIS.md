# SonarQube Final Analysis Guide

## Current Situation

You're running this from within a Docker container, which makes mounting volumes to another Docker container challenging. Here are your options:

## Option 1: Copy Project to Host and Run

```bash
# On your host machine (not in container)
# Copy the project out
docker cp claude-instance4:/app/data/projects/cyberpunk-gm-screen-v2 ./

# Navigate to the copied directory
cd cyberpunk-gm-screen-v2

# Run scanner directly on host
docker run \
    --rm \
    --network="cyberpunk-gm-screen-v2_sonarnet" \
    -v "$(pwd):/usr/src" \
    -e SONAR_HOST_URL="http://sonarqube:9000" \
    -e SONAR_TOKEN="sqp_4e4f5fff65a5c6c7a2f8b270283baf3cae7cf566" \
    sonarsource/sonar-scanner-cli
```

## Option 2: Install Scanner in Container

```bash
# As root in current container
apt-get update
apt-get install -y wget unzip
wget https://binaries.sonarsource.com/Distribution/sonar-scanner-cli/sonar-scanner-cli-4.7.0.2747-linux.zip
unzip sonar-scanner-cli-4.7.0.2747-linux.zip
export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/sonar-scanner-4.7.0.2747-linux/bin

# Run scanner directly
sonar-scanner \
  -Dsonar.host.url=http://172.22.0.3:9000 \
  -Dsonar.token=sqp_4e4f5fff65a5c6c7a2f8b270283baf3cae7cf566 \
  -Dsonar.projectKey=cyberpunk-gm-screen-v2
```

## Option 3: Use SonarQube API Directly

Since the analysis ran but found no files, you already have some results. Check:
http://localhost:9000/dashboard?id=cyberpunk-gm-screen-v2

## What Happened

1. ✅ SonarQube is running
2. ✅ Authentication works
3. ✅ Project exists
4. ❌ Volume mounting failed (container-in-container issue)
5. ✅ Analysis completed (but no source files)

## Recommendation

The easiest solution is to run the analysis from your host machine, not from within this container. The SonarQube server is accessible at `localhost:9000` from your host.

## Current Analysis Results

Even though no source files were analyzed, you can still:
1. View the project dashboard
2. Configure quality gates
3. See the empty analysis report
4. Prepare for proper analysis from host

**To properly analyze the code, run the scanner from your host machine where Docker volume mounts work correctly.**
