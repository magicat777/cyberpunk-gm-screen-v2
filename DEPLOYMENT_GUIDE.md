# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Current Status

âœ… **Production Build Complete**
- Build artifacts in `dist/` directory (1.9MB)
- All features implemented and tested
- Ready for deployment

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub

Since git authentication is not configured in this environment, you'll need to push from your local machine:

```bash
# From your local machine, add this remote if not already added
git remote add origin https://github.com/magicat777/cyberpunk-gm-screen-v2.git

# Push the main branch
git push origin main
```

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages (if not already enabled)

1. Go to your repository settings: https://github.com/magicat777/cyberpunk-gm-screen-v2/settings
2. Scroll down to the "Pages" section
3. Under "Build and deployment", ensure:
   - Source: GitHub Actions
   - You see "Your site is configured to be deployed from GitHub Actions"

### 3. Trigger Deployment

The deployment will automatically trigger when you push to the main branch. You have two deployment workflows:

- `deploy.yml` - Uses npm
- `cd.yml` - Uses yarn

Either workflow will build and deploy your site.

### 4. Monitor Deployment

1. Go to the Actions tab: https://github.com/magicat777/cyberpunk-gm-screen-v2/actions
2. Look for the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow run
3. Click on it to see the progress
4. Wait for both the "build" and "deploy" jobs to complete successfully

### 5. Access Your Deployed Site

Once deployment is complete, your site will be available at:

**https://magicat777.github.io/cyberpunk-gm-screen-v2/**

Note: The first deployment may take a few minutes to become available.

## Build Configuration

The project is configured for GitHub Pages deployment:

- Base path: `/cyberpunk-gm-screen-v2/` (set in vite.config.ts)
- Build output: `dist/` directory
- Static assets: Properly handled with base path

## Manual Deployment Alternative

If you prefer to deploy manually:

```bash
# Build locally
npm run build

# Deploy using gh-pages package
npm install -g gh-pages
gh-pages -d dist
```

## Troubleshooting

### If the site doesn't load correctly:

1. Check that the base path in `vite.config.ts` matches your repository name
2. Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
3. Clear browser cache and try again
4. Check browser console for errors

### If deployment fails:

1. Check the Actions tab for error messages
2. Ensure all dependencies are correctly specified in package.json
3. Verify that the build completes locally without errors

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:

1. Test all features on the live site
2. Check responsive design on mobile devices
3. Verify accessibility features work correctly
4. Test save/load functionality
5. Share the URL with users for feedback
